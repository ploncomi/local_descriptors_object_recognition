# local_descriptors_object_recognition

This repository contains an object recognizer based on local descriptors, developed by the year 2005.

It implements the paper:

A Fast Probabilistic Model for Hypothesis Rejection in SIFT-Based Object Recognition


This detector rejects wrong detection hypothesis by applying a cascade of several tests.

Note: This code was written using a very old C++ standard. However, it was slighty modified for compiling in current compilers, but generates a lot of warnings.
