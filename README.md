# local_descriptors_object_recognition

This repository contains an object recognizer based on local descriptors, developed by the year 2005.

It implements the paper:

`Loncomilla, P., Ruiz-del-Solar, J. (2006). A Fast Probabilistic Model for Hypothesis Rejection in SIFT-Based Object Recognition. In: Mart√≠nez-Trinidad, J.F., Carrasco Ochoa, J.A., Kittler, J. (eds) Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis and Applications. CIARP 2006. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 4225. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. https://doi.org/10.1007/11892755_72`


This detector rejects wrong detection hypothesis by applying a cascade of several tests.

Note: This code was written using a very old C++ standard / compiler. However, it was slighty modified for compiling in current compilers, but it generates a lot of warnings.

An example use is shown in main.cpp
